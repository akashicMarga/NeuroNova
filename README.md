# NeuroNova

A comprehensive open-source project combining physics simulation, quantum computing, and reinforcement learning in Rust. Designed for curious minds exploring physics, mathematics, and artificial intelligence.

## Overview

NeuroNova aims to provide an educational and experimental platform where learners can:
- Explore quantum mechanics through simulations
- Visualize complex physical systems
- Implement and test reinforcement learning algorithms
- Experiment with custom physics environments

## Project Structure

### Quantum Simulator
Current implementation includes:
- Schrödinger equation solver
- Quantum circuit simulator
- Basic quantum gates (X, Y, Z, H, CNOT, etc.)
- Visualization tools for quantum states and wavefunctions

Key features:
- Time evolution of quantum states
- Energy level calculations
- Probability density visualization
- Multiple potential types support

### Coming Soon
- Classical physics simulators
- Custom RL environments
- Integration of RL agents with quantum/classical systems
- Advanced visualization tools
- Interactive learning environments

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```rust
[dependencies]
nalgebra = "0.32"
plotly = "0.8.3"
rand = "0.8"
```

### Basic Usage
```rust
// Create a quantum circuit
let mut circuit = QuantumCircuit::new(2);
circuit.apply_gate(HadamardGate, 0);
circuit.apply_controlled_gate(XGate, 0, 1);

// Solve Schrödinger equation
let solver = SchrodingerSolver::new(1000, 0.01).unwrap();
let wavefunction = solver.wave_functions(0).unwrap();
```
